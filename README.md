=========

A gaming keypad (and custom Rust firmware thereof) that might just happen to fit in the plastic case of the Razer Tartarus v2.  Supports an analog joystick, 4 software layers, and toggleable WASD encoding of the joystick.

Loosely based on [PyPad](https://github.com/Ayehavgunne/pypad).

(PCB, LED support, and plate design in progress)
